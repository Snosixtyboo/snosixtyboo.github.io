## About Me

I am a Co-Principal Investigator associated with the **Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)** for the project on Instant Visualization and Interaction for Large Point Clouds at TU Wien. Before that, I was a Visiting Researcher at the **Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University**, in the Human Sensing Lab under Fernando de La Torre. I obtained my PhD at **Graz University of Technology** in 2018. In 2019, I briefly joined Epic Games to work on **Unreal Engine 5's Nanite**. I started a postdoc at TU Wien the same year, followed by another in 2022 with **INRIA** in George Drettakis' GraphDeco group. 

My research focuses on real-time graphics, parallel processing, point-based rendering, image-based rendering, radiance fields and novel-view synthesis. Together with my esteemed colleagues, our research has been honored with Best Paper awards at major graphics conferences, including **SIGGRAPH**, **High-Performance Graphics**, **Pacific Graphics**, **EGPGV**, and **GRAPP**.

I have lectured on the topics of GPU programming, real-time rendering, physically-based rendering, game physics and scientific working at **TU Wien**, **Graz University of Technology** and **FH Salzburg**.
