## About Me

I am a Principal Investigator at the **Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)**, focussing on real-time graphics, parallel processing, point-based rendering, image-based rendering, radiance fields and novel-view synthesis. Before, I obtained my PhD at **Graz University** of Technology in 2018. In 2019, I briefly joined Epic Games to work on **Unreal Engine 5's Nanite**. I started a postdoc at TU Wien the same year, followed by another in 2022 with **INRIA** in George Drettakis' GraphDeco group. 

Together with my esteemed colleagues, our research has been honored with Best Paper awards at major graphics conferences, including **SIGGRAPH**, **High-Performance Graphics** and **GRAPP**.

## Research Interests
